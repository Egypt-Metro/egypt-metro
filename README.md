# Egypt Metro Project

## Overview

**Egypt Metro** is an integrated metro system management platform designed to improve the commuting experience. The platform provides a seamless and efficient way for passengers to plan trips, track trains, and manage tickets, all while leveraging AI for crowd management and optimized routing. The project is composed of three main components: the frontend (Flutter), backend (Django), and AI models (TensorFlow).

## Features

- **Route and Trip Planning**: Plan your trip, view metro lines, stations, and ticket prices.
- **Train Schedules**: Get real-time updates on train arrivals and locations.
- **Crowd Management**: Predict and visualize crowded train cars using AI.
- **User Profiles**: Create and manage profiles, including monthly/student pass options.
- **QR Code Ticketing**: Generate and scan QR codes for tickets.
- **Chatbot Support**: Assist users with FAQs and navigation.
- **Fault Reporting**: Report issues and track resolutions in real-time.
- **Multiple Payment Methods**: Secure payment options for tickets and subscriptions.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Track revenue, sales, and station performance in real-time.

## Architecture

The project follows a **modular architecture**:
- **Frontend**: Flutter-based mobile/web app (see `egypt-metro-flutter`).
- **Backend**: Django API (see `egypt-metro-backend`).
- **AI**: TensorFlow models for congestion prediction and route optimization (see `egypt-metro-ai`).
